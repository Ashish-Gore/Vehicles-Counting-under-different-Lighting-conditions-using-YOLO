# Vehicles Counting under different Lighting conditions using YOLO.


## Project Overview:
The main goal of this project is to implement vehicle counting in a highway scenario using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. The project focuses on detecting various types of vehicles such as cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles, and then accurately counting the number of vehicles passing through a designated transition line. The direction of their movement (in or out) is also tracked.


## The objectives of the project are:

**1. Vehicle Detection:**
Implement YOLO for the detection of vehicles in a highway environment. This involves identifying and classifying different types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles.

**2. Transition Line Counting:**
Establish a transition line within the highway scene to monitor the movement of vehicles. Count the number of vehicles that pass through this line and determine their direction (inward or outward).

**3. Total Vehicle Counting under Different Lighting Conditions:**
Perform vehicle counting under various lighting conditions to ensure robustness and adaptability of the system. The project aims to achieve accurate vehicle counting regardless of lighting challenges.

## Implementation:
The project utilizes the YOLO algorithm due to its efficiency and real-time object detection capabilities. The code is structured to achieve the objectives outlined above, and the implementation is designed to handle diverse lighting conditions.


## Usage:
### 1. Vehicles Counting under Good Lighting:

Under optimal lighting conditions, the system accurately detects and counts vehicles using the YOLO algorithm.
### Good Lighting Samples:

### 2. Vehicles Counting under Challenging Lighting Conditions:

The system is designed to adapt to varying lighting conditions, ensuring reliable vehicle counting even in challenging scenarios.

### Moderate Lighting Samples:

### Low Lighting Samples:

### Very Low Lighting Samples:

### SnowFall Samples:
